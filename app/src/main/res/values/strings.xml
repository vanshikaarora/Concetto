        Here is the mission for you. The robot you make has to play a crucial role. The mission is to carry THE SECRET
CODES from CODE_SQUARE to DATA_RING. You do not have much time. The clock is ticking fast. Should you
choose to accept it?\n
        <b>PROBLEM STATEMENT</b>
Teams have to build an autonomous bot that can follow a black line over a brightly coloured surface to move
between the different zones and perform the required tasks. The arena will consist of the Starting Zone (SZ),
Code Square(CS) , Data Ring (DR) and timers T1 and T2. The bot will start from the SZ and follow the thick white
path. It will reach the CS where it has to identify a set of operators (+, -, x, %) and operands (p, q, r), where p, q,
r are small integers encoded using combinations of LEDs. The mapping of operators and operands to LEDs of
CS are shown clearly in table 1. The bot has to calculate that arithmetic expression. Once it has done its work
at CS, it has to move to DR, where it shall transmit of evaluated result (magnitude only) of expression using its
binary equivalent with the help of a set of 5-LEDs (An ON LED will represent ‘1’ and an OFF LED will represent
‘0’).

    </string>
    <string name="flashtasks">
        <b>Level 1:</b>\n
The first task will check the bot’s locomotion capabilities. The bot will have to travel path by following the thick
black line. The bots who are successfully able to do this will qualify this stage.
Bot should complete this level without any human intervention. In case of any human intervention the
respective penalties will be awarded.\n\n
Maximum time limit : 10 minutes.\n
        <b>Points awarded:</b>\n\n
 50 points on completion of level.\n
 15 points for successfully crossing ‘L’ junction.\n
 -5 for each human intervention.\n
<b>Level 2:</b>\n
The Second level is where the real challenge begins. The bot will start from SZ and travel the path to reach CS.
Now according to code table (as shown below), read and decode the code given through LED’s and convert it
into a meaningful arithmetic expression and then calculate the value and store that value as it will be used
later. The four LEDs will be initially OFF and the bot has to stop itself after entering the black CS square. After
that all the four LEDs will be ON simultaneously for some time(4-5 seconds) followed by the LED codes which
the bot has to detect and perform required operation. The codes and further details about the reading of LEDs
have been mentioned along with the code table in the READING MODE section below. After taking the
readings from CS the bot will move to DR. In between the bot will encounter a T-junction where the bot has
two options i.e. to go through an elevated bridge(For which the will be awarded bonus points as mentioned
below) or a level path with a curve .Once it reaches DR, the bot is required to display the calculated output
number in the form of binary which is advised to be done with the help of 5-LEDs placed in a line (array) on the
bot.\n\n
Maximum time limit : 15 minutes.\n
        <b>Points awarded:</b>\n
 20 points for stopping at CS.\n
 10 points for successfully collecting data from CS.\n
 10 points for crossing to path break.\n
 70 points for displaying correct answer at DR\n.
 -5 points for touch for each physical contact.\n
 [BONUS] +20 points : If the bot chooses to climb the bridge and successfully climbs it.\n\n
        <b>Tie-breaker Level:</b>\n
In case of a tie between two or more teams, travel time between T1 and T2 will be used for breaking the tie.\n
In case of further tie, other quantitative strategies will be employed.

The aim of the competition is to provide students with an opportunity to design and
construct a small chemically powered car and test the ability of participants to safely
control and harness the energy of a chemical reaction by initiating the car and allowing
it to traverse a fixed distance carrying a certain load.\n\n
        A)   <b>ROUND 1</b>\n

➣ Each Team will be allowed to give one run to test their model. In this run, the model would
     be checked whether it emits harmful chemicals (concentrated acid, poisonous gases,
     etc.),  your team would be eliminated if chemicals are hazardous and harmful for the
     Surroundings.\n

➣The model should cover a minimum distance of 5m. If they are unable to do so, their
    teams would be disqualified.\n

B) <b>ROUND 2</b>\n

➣The car is expected to carry a specified payload (most probably water) of 500
    grams(Note: payload will be provided at the competition site.)\n
➣The car must have a chamber for the container in which load will be placed.\n
➣One of the organiser from our team will measure the payload and it would be
    given to you to pour it into your container.

C)  <b>ROUND 3</b>\n

The final qualifications for stage 3 would entirely be dependent on stage 2 winners.The teams will be asked to give a brief overview (lasting 4 minutes) about their model to the judges, followed by viva by the judges.. The Teams will be questioned, and based on their understanding and the performance of the model they will be graded.

    Your team is given a list of reactions which is required to completed. To complete
It, your team require certain chemicals. At the starting you’ve certain chemical, but the twist is they are insufficient to complete any one of reaction.\n\n

    <b>Solution</b>\n
You’ve to trade your chemicals with other teams. So, every team has to decide which chemicals to sold, and bought. Now, trading would be in form of bidding, and would be through bank (organizers) only.\n
Winner will be decided on the basis of maximum no. of reactions completed at the end of event.

        <b>How to play</b>
Every team will be given a ledger, on which they’ve to register every trade they’ve made during each round of bidding.\n

Ex. \n




Compound
Round 1 Round 2 Round 3
A  B  C
+2 -  -\n
-1 +3 -\n
-  +4 -\n
        Here +2 represent buying, while -1 represents selling.\n\n


<b>Pricing Dynamics:</b>\n
Initially certain value would given by bank to every compound. As rounds we’ll be progress prices will change based on the rule of demand and supply. Compounds higher in demand, will have higher price, and vice versa for compounds low in demand.\n

Ex.\n
Let every chemical have an intial value of $100/mol.\n
Take Team 1, it has 2 moles of compound B.\n
And it bids chemical A $100/mol, for 0.5 mol.\n
Hence, Team 1 has to exchange 1mol of B\n
For Bank,\n
Then, before bidding\n
        Compound A        Compound B\n
Price(mol)    $100 (1)        $100 (1)\n

After bidding,\n\n
        Compound A        Compound B\n
Price(mol)    $200(0.5)        $100(2)\n
    =$400(1)        = $50\n

    <string name="laserabt">Laser tag is a tag game played with guns which fire infrared beams. Infrared-sensitive targets are commonly worn by each player and are sometimes integrated within the arena in which the game is played. There are flashing targets on your front, shoulders, back and on the sides and front of the gun. When you fire the gun, a laser beam is projected towards your target and when you are shot, your pack is deactivated for up to four seconds.A session lasts only 15 minutes and the rules insist there’s no running,climbing,crouching or crawling - so it’s not a game that burns a great number of calories. But it does engage all your senses, like a Native American tracker, as you try to assess where the next danger is coming from, and attempt to pick off your enemies.If there’s only two of you, staff will aim to integrate you with another group so it’s more fun. At the end, scores are displayed on monitors, and your individual hits are broken down.
If you’ve always secretly fancied yourself as an action hero trapped on a demonic spaceship facing an unknown enemy (and who hasn’t?), it’s got to be worth a try.

        <b>“Limit poker is a science, but no-limit is an art. In limit, you are shooting at a target. In no-limit, the target comes alive and shoots back at you”</b>\n\n

While Poker is played in innumerable forms, a player who understands the values of the Poker hands and the principles of betting can play without difficulty in any type of Poker game. Except in a few versions of the game, a Poker hand consists of five cards. The various combinations of Poker hands rank from five of a kind (the highest) to no pair or nothing (the lowest):\n\n

        <b>Five of a Kind</b>\n – This is the highest possible hand and can occur only in games where at least one card is wild, such as a joker, the two one-eyed jacks, or the four deuces. Examples of five of a kind would be four 10s and a wild card or two queens and three wild cards.
Straight Flush – This is the highest possible hand when only the standard pack is used, and there are no wild cards. A straight flush consists of five cards of the same suit in sequence, such as 10, 9, 8, 7, 6 of hearts. The highest-ranking straight flush is the A, K, Q, J, and 10 of one suit, and this combination has a special name: a royal flush or a royal straight flush. The odds on being dealt this hand are 1 in almost 650,000.\n
        <b>Four of a Kind –</b>\n This is the next highest hand, and it ranks just below a straight flush. An example is four aces or four 3s. It does not matter what the fifth, unmatched card is.
Full House – This colorful hand is made up of three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank, such as three 8s and two 4s, or three aces and two 6s.
Flush – Five cards, all of the same suit, but not all in sequence, is a flush. An example is Q, 10, 7, 6, and 2 of clubs.
Straight – Five cards in sequence, but not all of the same suit is a straight. An example is 9♥, 8♣, 7♠, 6♦, 5♥.\n
        <b>Three of a Kind –</b> This combination contains three cards of the same rank, and the other two cards each of a different rank, such as three jacks, a seven, and a four.
Two Pairs – This hand contains a pair of one rank and another pair of a different rank, plus any fifth card of a different rank, such as Q, Q, 7, 7, 4.
One Pair – This frequent combination contains just one pair with the other three cards being of different rank. An example is 10, 10, K, 4, 3.
No Pair – This very common hand contains "nothing." None of the five cards pair up, nor are all five cards of the same suit or consecutive in rank. When more than one player has no pair, the hands are rated by the highest card each hand contains, so that an ace-high hand beats a king-high hand, and so on\n\n
        <b>CHIPS</b>
Poker is almost always played with poker chips. For a game with seven or more players, there should be a supply of at least 200 chips. Usually, the white chip (or the lightest-colored chip) is the unit, or lowest-valued chip, worth whatever the minimum ante or bet is; a red chip (or some other colored chip) is worth five whites, and a blue chip (or some other dark-colored chip) is worth 10 or 20 or 25 whites or two, four or five reds. At the start of the game, each player "buys in" by purchasing a certain number of chips. All of the players usually buy in for the same amount.
Betting/n
In the course of each Poker deal, there will be one or more betting intervals in which the players have an opportunity to bet on their hands. Minimizing losses with poor hands and maximizing winnings with good hands is the underlying skill that Poker requires.
Before the cards are even dealt, the rules of the Poker game being played may require that each player put an initial contribution, called an "ante," of one or more chips into the pot, to start it off.
Each betting interval, or round, begins when a player, in turn, makes a bet of one or more chips. Each player to the left, in turn, must either "call" that bet by putting into the pot the same number of chips; or "raise," which means that he puts in more than enough chips to call; or "drop" ("fold"), which means that he puts no chips in the pot, discards his hand, and is out of the betting until the next deal.
When a player drops, he loses any chips he has put into that pot. Unless a player is willing to put into the pot at least as many chips as any preceding player, he must drop out.
A betting interval ends when the bets have been equalized - that is, when each player has either put in exactly as many chips as his predecessors or has dropped. There are usually two or more betting intervals for each Poker deal. After the final interval there is a "showdown," which means that each player who remains shows his hand face up on the table. The best Poker hand then takes the pot.
If a player makes a bet or a raise that no other player calls, he wins the pot without showing his hand. Thus, in Poker, there is a bluffing element, and the best combination of cards does not always win the pot! Bluffing is one of the key reasons why Poker is so popular.
If a player wishes to remain in the game without betting, he "checks." This means, in effect, that the player is making a "bet of nothing." A player may check provided no one before him in that betting interval has made a bet. If another player has bet, he cannot check but must at least call the bet or drop. A player who checks may raise a bet that has been raised by another player. This is called "sandbagging," which is allowed, unless it has been decided beforehand that this practice is forbidden. If all players check during a round of play, the betting interval is over, and all the players still in the pot remain in the game.
In each betting round, one player is designated as the first bettor, according to the rules of the game. The turn to bet always moves to the left, from player to player, and no one may check, bet, or even drop, except when it is his turn.
